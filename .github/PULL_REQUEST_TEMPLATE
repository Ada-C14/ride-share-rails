Congratulations! You're submitting your assignment. Please reflect on the assignment with these questions. These questions should be answered by all team members together, not by a single teammate.

## Reflection

Prompt | Response
--- | ---
Describe the types of entity relationships you set up in your project and why you set up the relationships that way | We had Trips belong to passengers and drivers.  Drivers dna passengers both had many trips.  These relationships were set up this way, because trips were getting their information from the driver and passenger classes.  Trips was also the connection between Passengers and drivers, and this relationship config allowed trips to be a link between the two classes.
Describe the role of model validations in your application | Model validations allowed parameters to simply be put in place.  These validations could "validate" different params based on the model keys.  Names, vins, phone numbers could all be accounted for in, kept us from having incomplete data sets, or improper types of information.
How did your team break up the work to be done? | We read and re-read the ReadMe, created a Trello plan, communicated about changes we were making, pushed and pulled a lot of git.  Also, worked together through all of it, learning together.
What features did you choose to prioritize in your project, and what features, if any, did you have to set aside to meet the deadline? |  We focused a good portion of our time on meeting the CRUD requirements for this assignment.  Testing was also something we both wanted to get better at and have been working through.  Creating the model methods and understanding why we would want to place methods in the models was also something that was new for us. We weren't able to work on our aesthetic or finish all testing. The goal was to meet as many functionality requirements as possible.  We also spent a healthy amount of time trying to figure out errors, and git issues.
What was one thing that your team collectively gained more clarity on after completing this assignment? | We learned a lot more about the database, model, controller, view relationships.  Getting to work through this project helped make the connections and functions they serve much clearer.  Also feel like we're walking away from this project with a better idea of how to tackle some of the trouble we ran into differently.  Retrospectively, could have definitely utilized more resources and maybe approached the assignment differently.
What are two discussion points that you and your team discussed when giving/receiving feedback from each other that you would be willing to share? |  We re-enforced encouragement. Talked about our learning goals & priorities.  Understanding the content and showing ourselves grace was big. I believe we both found this very challenging and learned a lot!
Optional: What is the URL of your deployed Heroku app? |
